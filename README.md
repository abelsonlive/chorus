# Chorus

Chorus is a very simple way to turn your mac into a chorus of "throat singers.":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY1pcEtHI_w
It uses the @say@ command.

## Installation

    $ gem install chorus

## Usage

	$ chorus "I just met you. This is crazy. Here's my number. Call me maybe?"

You can pass in many of the same options that @say@ supports.
For more information look up @say@'s man page.

	$ chorus -h
